# Monte Carlo project
For our Monte Carlo class , we reproduce the simulation experiments of the paper "On Multilevel Monte Carlo Unbiased Gradient Estimation for Deep Latent Variable Models" written by Yuyang Shi and Rob Cornish in 2021. We limit ourselves to the Linear Gaussian framework to quantify the bias and the variance of the computed estimators.
